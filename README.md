# Image-classification-using-Neural-Network

This project is about training a neural network to recognize if an input image is a human face or not. Over 10000 imags are taken for training purpose.We are using Tensorflow for building Sequential neural network model.

In this project we are comparing results of Hinge Loss and Binary cross Entropy Loss function. In the end we are Tuning the hyperparameter such as number of neurons per layer, learning rate, activation function, weight initializer etc with RandomizedsearchCV to get a better model.
